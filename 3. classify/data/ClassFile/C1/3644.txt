&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNew provisions regarding the use of rights of way by motorised vehicles will come into effect tomorrow (Tuesday, 2 May). 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThese provisions in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 will significantly curtail the scope for adding further public rights of way for motor vehicles, known as byways open to all traffic (BOATs), to the definitive map and statement (the local highway authorities¡¯ legal record of public rights of way). 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRural Affairs Minister, Jim Knight, said: 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"The Government is delivering our commitment to curtail the inappropriate use of green lanes and ancient ways by motor vehicles, by putting an end to claims for motor vehicular use of them on the basis of historical use, and evidence of that use, by horse-drawn vehicles, as soon possible. 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"Some of the worst damage is happening in our national parks, which is why we have given National Park Authorities the power to make traffic regulation orders, to commence later this year. 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"We must ensure that our green lanes, ancient ways and rights of way are protected for the enjoyment of everyone who use these important parts of our countryside, now and in the future." 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe new provisions will extinguish - subject to certain exceptions - all unrecorded public rights of way for motor vehicles, so that they cannot then be claimed as BOATs under the fundamental legal principal ¡®once a highway, always a highway¡¯. The Act also prevents use by motor vehicles giving rise to any kind of public right of way. A new category of right of way - "restricted byway" - to make these provisions work on the ground is used within the Act. It enables ways where vehicular rights have been acquired by non-motorised vehicles, such as horse-drawn vehicles, to be recorded as restricted byways rather than BOATs, ensuring that the future use of these ways will be consistent with their history. 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRestricted byways were first introduced by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. The relevant provisions of that Act and changes to other highways legislation are also taking effect on Tuesday (2 May) in order to dovetail with the commencement of parts of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. Restricted byways can be used by pedestrians, horse-riders, cyclists, and those who wish to use them with a horse and cart or carriage. 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHowever, when these provisions come into force it will be an offence under the Road Traffic Act 1988 to drive a motorised vehicle on a restricted byway except in certain circumstances. 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBecause some people rely on a public right of way for motor vehicles to access their land or property, the Act provides for a private right of way for such people, wherever a public right of way for motor vehicles is extinguished, and an exemption from prosecution in limited cases.
