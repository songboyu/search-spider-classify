holding of this month's traditional kite-flying festival. 

Flying a kite in Pakistan is a dangerous pastime. 
Already it's banned for all but 15 days of the year but a provincial minister 
warned kite-flyers this week that any who cause injury or death with string made 
from metal or coated with glass could be tried under anti-terrorism laws. 
The Punjabi chief minister's unprecedented threat came just ahead of the start of an annual kite-flying 
festival in the provincial capital, Lahore, Sunday. 
Kite-flying in Pakistan and neighboring India often involves aerial duels in which participants try to bring 
down each other's kites using string coated in a sticky paste of ground-up glass 
or metal. 
Every year, Pakistani media report dozens of deaths and injuries caused by 
kite flying, mainly of children and motorcyclists whose throats are sometimes 
cut by metal or glass-coated string. 
Elahi said a crackdown had been launched against the sale of sharp kite 
string and threatened a permanent ban on kite-flying if deaths continued. 
"Action under the Anti-Terrorism Act would be taken in case of deaths due to 
... dangerous kite-flying string," he was quoted as saying. 
Pakistan's Supreme Court banned kite-flying nationwide last year in response 
to an outcry over injuries and deaths. The ban was lifted for a 15-day period to 
allow the holding of this month's traditional kite-flying festival.

在巴基斯坦，放风筝是项危险的娱乐活动。 
尽管今年解除放风筝的禁令大致有15天，巴基斯坦的一位省长已在本周警告放风筝者，若因用金属线或玻璃制品制成的风筝线造成伤亡事故，政府会按照国家的反恐法对肇事者进行审判。&nbsp; 

就在旁遮普省首府拉尔市准备在周日召开一年一度的风筝节前，旁遮普省省长发出了这个史无前例的警告。 
在巴基斯坦和其邻国印度，放风筝的人常常在天空中"斗"风筝，他们用金属线或者沾满玻璃碎片的风筝线把其他人的风筝从空中击落。 
每年，巴基斯坦媒体都要报道几十起因放风筝而引起的伤亡事故，受害者往往是小孩或摩托车手，他们有时会被金属风筝线或风筝线上的玻璃划伤咽喉。 
伊拉希说，政府已经禁止兜售锋利的风筝线，如果死亡事故继续发生，政府有可能颁布永久性禁放令，禁止人们放风筝。 
引用他的话说："由于危险的风筝线而造成的死亡事故将依据国家反恐怖法进行处理。" 
去年，由于公众抗议因放风筝而引发的伤亡事故，巴基斯坦最高法庭在全国颁布了禁放风筝的法令。本月，为了能举行一年一度的风筝节，巴政府允许解除禁令15天。
