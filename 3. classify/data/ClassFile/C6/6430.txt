
　　Beer flows from house taps in Norway
　　A woman thought she was in heaven when beer instead of water flowed from 
the taps in her apartment in west Norway.
　　"I turned on the tap to clean some knives and forks and beer came out," 
Haldis Gundersen told Reuters from her home in Kristiansund, west Norway. "We 
thought we were in heaven."
　　Beer in Norway is among the most expensive in the world with a 0.4 litre 
(0.7 pint) costing about 50 crowns (4.3 pounds) in a bar.
　　Gundersen said she tried the beer but that it tasted a bit odd and was not 
fizzy.
　　It turned out that a worker in a bar two floors below had mixed up the 
pipes, wrongly connecting a new barrel to a water pipe leading to Gundersen's 
flat. The bar got water in its beer taps.
　　当发现自家水龙头里流出的是啤酒而非自来水时，这位家住挪威西部的主妇以为自己到了天堂。
　　"当我打开水龙头准备清洗刀叉时，发现水龙头里流出的是啤酒，"住在挪威西部克里斯蒂安桑德城的哈尔德斯・贡诺森在家里告诉路透社："我们当时还以为到了天堂呢"。
　　挪威是世界上啤酒价格最为昂贵的地方之一，在酒吧，0.4升（合0.7品脱）的啤酒售价是50克朗（合4.3英镑）。
　　贡诺森说她试着尝了一下水龙头里的啤酒，但觉得味道有点怪，而且这些啤酒没有泡沫。
　　事后证明，原因出在贡诺森家下楼两层的一个酒吧身上，一名工作人员插错了水管和啤酒管的插头，给贡诺森家输送自来水的水管插头被错插到一个新的啤酒桶里，而酒吧的啤酒龙头里流出的则是自来水
