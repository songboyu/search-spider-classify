A first edition of a Donald Duck comic book from 1948 has been held 
behind bars in Sweden for a 
year-and-a-half amid a divorcing couple's drawn-out custody battle. 
The 58-year-old comic book was part of a collection at a museum in Koeinge, 
in southern Sweden, run by the couple. 
When they split up, they both claimed to be the rightful owner of the comic 
book. But in 2004, one of the couple decided to shut down the museum and sold 
the comic book to a third party, regional daily Hallandsposten reported in its 
online edition. 
As a result, the other spouse reported the comic as stolen to police, and it 
was confiscated pending a ruling. 
If in mint condition, the item 
would be considered a rarity by collectors and could be worth up to 125000 
kronor(16200 dollars, 13,345 euros), according to Swedish news agency TT. 
Prosecutor Sonja Seligmann said she would soon rule on the matter. 
In the meantime, the comic book remains under 
lock and key with the Halland police.

一本1948年首次出版的唐老鸭漫画书在瑞典卷入一对夫妇的漫长离婚官司。夫妇二人对这本漫画书的保管权争执不休，致使该书被瑞典警方“关押”了一年半。这本漫画书已有58年的历史，原本收藏在瑞典南部Koeinge一家由该夫妇经营的博物馆里。 

这对夫妇关系破裂后，均声称自己是唐老鸭漫画书的合法主人。但2004年，据当地《哈兰日报》网络版报道，这对夫妇中有一人决定关闭博物馆并把漫画书卖给第三方。 
之后，另一人则报警称漫画书被盗，警方由此收管该书，等待法庭做出判决。 
据瑞典TT通讯社报道，收藏家认为如果这本漫画书保存完好，它将是一件珍品，价值12.5万冰岛克朗（约16200美元或13345欧元）。 
检察官索尼亚・塞利格曼说，她将尽快处理此案。 
在这期间，唐老鸭漫画书仍由哈兰警方妥善保管。
