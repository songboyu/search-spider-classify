
　　Breast cancer is killing 70 men a year in Britain, often because men are 
too shy or too ignorant about the symptoms to get medical help.
　　Prof Ian Fentiman, a leading cancer specialist from Guy's Hospital, London, 
said yesterday that 250 men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year.
　　In a report in The Lancet he said: "There is evident need for national 
protocols for both information and support for men diagnosed with breast 
cancer."
　　Prof Fentiman added: "Half the men who get breast cancer in the United 
Kingdom are not diagnosed until their cancer is very advanced, and men are dying 
unnecessarily because they are unaware of the symptoms or because they are too 
embarrassed to seek help."
　　The most common signs of male breast cancer are a painless lump in the 
chest or a nipple which has turned inwards, but these are similar to the effects 
of gynaecomastia, a harmless swelling under the nipple.
　　在英国，每年死于乳腺癌的男性大约为70人，因为男性乳腺癌患者通常因害羞或不重视而最终导致病情延误到晚期。
　　据英国《每日电讯报》2月17日报道，伦敦盖伊医院的癌症专家伊恩・芬蒂曼教授日前指出，英国每年约有250名男性被诊断出患有乳腺癌。芬蒂曼还说：“英国许多男性都是在病情恶化后才被最终诊断出患有乳腺癌的，这是因为他们忽视病情或害怕尴尬而不去就医的结果，本可以避免的死亡却没能避免。”
　　芬蒂曼曾在一份研究报告中呼吁：“国家应当给男性乳腺癌患者提供更多的信息和帮助。”
　　专家提醒说，男性乳腺癌最显著的症状是在胸部或乳头处出现无痛的肿块，而当出现诸如肿块和肿胀感、皮肤凹陷和起皱、乳头内陷、乳头或者乳房皮肤泛红、乳头大小异常或乳头溢液时，就应尽快去看医生。
