
　　Nearly half of motorists regularly talk to their cars, giving words of 
encouragement ahead of a long trip and lavishing praise for a job well done at 
journey's end, according to research on Monday.
　　A survey of 2,000 owners also found 40 percent thought their car had a 
personality and was capable of being upset whilst 19 percent worried about how 
their car was feeling.
　　The poll, conducted by organisers of July's British International Motor 
Show found women rather than men tended to have a close relationship with their 
car. Giving a pet name to their car but not their human partners was admitted to 
by 20 percent of women
　　The survey that revealed fully 47 percent of drivers talked to their cars 
also looked at how people felt about their cars across the country.
　　Drivers in the southwest worry most about their car's feelings, with 36 
percent admitting concern compared with just 15 percent in the Midlands.
　　Drivers in the northeast were most likely to attribute a character to their 
vehicles with 68 percent saying their car had a personality, compared with 28 
percent in Wales.
　　More people chat happily to their cars in the southwest than anywhere else 
in the country, with 54 percent enjoying a good chat, compared with the more 
taciturn Scots where 26 percent indulged.
　　Half of all cars on East Anglian roads rejoiced in a pet name compared with 
just 31 percent of cars in the southeast.
　　一项最新的调查显示，英国几乎有一半（47％）的有车族会常常和自己的爱车“说话”。他们常常在长途旅行前，给爱车以语言上的鼓励；当旅程结束后，他们也会对爱车的“出色表现”大加赞扬。
　　据路透社2月20日报道，这项调查是由将于7月份开始的英国国际车展的组织者进行的，调查涉及英国的2000名车主。调查结果显示，有40％的人认为他们的汽车具备某种性格特点，爱车可以感觉到不舒服。19％的被调查者还会为他们爱车的感觉如何而操心。
　　调查发现，与男性相比，女性往往和自己的爱车拥有更加亲密的关系。有大约20％被调查的女性承认，她们会给予自己的爱车而不是自己的伴侣以爱称。
　　调查结果显示，在英国各个不同的地区，“有车族”对自己爱车有不同的感觉。英国西南部的车主最关心的是他们爱车的感受。当地有36％的车主承认最关心此问题，而英国中部地区则只有区区15％的人关心这个问题。英国东北部地区的车主则最愿意给自己的爱车加上某种人性化的东西――有68％的人认为他们的汽车具备某种性格特点，而威尔士地区只有28％的车主这么认为。英国西南部地区的车主和其它地区的车主相比，更愿意和自己的爱车开心地交谈。而英国东盎格鲁地区则有将近一半的车主喜欢用亲密的爱称来称呼自己的汽车。
