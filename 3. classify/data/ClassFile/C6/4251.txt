　　This is a story about the Hanshi Festival. 它发生在2000多年前春秋时代的晋国。
　　Chong Er was one of the princes but his father didn't like him. Some bad 
people told his father that Chong Er was going to rebel. So he had to run away 
from the country. 逃亡途中，公子重耳和保护他的几位大臣在山里迷了路。In the mountains, they didn't get 
enough food. Chong Er almost starved to death. 
为了救重耳，一名叫介子推的大臣偷偷从大腿上割了一块肉让他充饥。When Chong Er later found out, he was moved to 
tears.
　　Years later, Chong Er became the King of the Jin Kingdom. He wanted to 
thank Jie and asked him to be his minister, but Jie refused. 
后来介子推在大火中不幸被烧死了。晋王重耳非常伤心，命令百姓在介子推去世那天不许生火做饭，只能吃冷食。这就是“寒食节”的由来。
　　从那时起人们都在这天祭奠祖先和纪念先烈，寒食节渐渐演变成了清明节。人们在这一天会去扫墓，怀念家里去世的亲人。所以英语里这一天也叫做“Tomb-sweeping Day”。
　　Chinese usually sweep tombs and fly kites on this day. Because Jie died at 
the foot of a willow, Chinese also cut sticks of willow and hang them over their 
gates.
　　清明的时候人们也纷纷出来放风筝。We usually fly kites in the daytime, but on that day，in 
some places, people fly kites at night. How can they see their kites at night? 
They tie some little lights to the kites. 
这些小灯笼就像闪烁的星星，被人们称为“神灯”。人们把风筝放上天后便剪断牵线，任凭它们飞往天涯海角。It is said that in this way 
people will also be protected from bad luck and disease..
　　清明节是中国的传统节日。However, there are similar festivals in many other 
countries.
　　墨西哥人每年会过“亡灵节”。The Day of the Dead is on November 2. 
传说死去亲人的亡灵在这一天会回家探亲。Candles are lit to help them find the way home. A lot of food 
and drink are prepared for them at home. 亲戚们会聚在一起怀念逝去的亲人。
　　朝鲜和韩国也有清明节。The Koreans don't cook on this day. They only eat cold food. 
They also plant trees on this day.
　　世界上还有很多国家也有类似的节日，像叙利亚、美国、突尼斯，只不过具体日期不同。通常人们也在这个特殊的日子里纪念为国捐躯的先烈。
