&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 一、仔细审题。 如果是看图写文，看懂每幅图之间的联系至关重要。 写要点。据每幅图写出一至两句话。因为每年高考书面表达一般控制在10句话，120个词左右。 
连句成文。每句话写好后，用适当的连词连接起来，使之上下连贯，呼应，通顺，简洁。 查错漏。完稿后，检查一下有没有时态，语态，拼写错误并逐一加以改正。 
卷面整洁。卷面整洁干净甚至比准确，通顺，简介更重要。因为整洁干净给阅卷人精神上带来愉悦，相对而言，分数自然要给得高一些。 
为了帮助同学们在平时写作练习的时候时刻牢记这些写作的基本要领，特编顺口溜如下：细审题，巧构思，列要点，防遗漏。写日记，同汉语；书信，通知格式要牢记。看清图表细梳理，写人记事按顺序；完稿后查遗漏，整洁干净莫忘记。 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 二, 高考英语书面表达高分策略：从遣词，造句，谋篇三个方面分析。 遣词的原则：使用高等级词汇及短语, 
如果仅仅记住几个简单基础的词汇,而且一味的重复低水平的英语知识点,还远远没有达到大学的入学要求。这就要求考生在平时的训练和考试当中，有意识的强化“复杂，高级”这两个概念，使自己的作文能力区别于普通学生的作文，使自己一下子就站在一个比别人高的位置上，充分显示自己的实力。 
平时学习过程中注意总结各种各样的词汇。以描述人物的词汇为例： 表达人物爱憎感情： like, love, be interested in, be fond 
of… hate, dislike, be tired of, lose interest in… happy, excited, pleased, 
satisfied, angry, sad, worried, disappointed, terrified, mad, frightened… 
介绍人物的影响及人们对人的评价： He became famous for his new theory. The people had come to 
love him as an inspiring leader. We regard Li Fei as our model. Lei Feng has 
been praised for his communist spirit. People spoke highly of him and all 
respected him. 常见描述人物性格，外貌和身体状况等的词语 good-looking /funny-looking /strong-looking 
/ugly-looking /dirty-looking /ordinary-looking /blue-eyed /white-eyed 
/warm-hearted /light-hearted /kind-hearted /absent-minded /tall /short 
/beautiful /pretty /lovely /naughty/ be blind /lame in /be in good or poor 
condition/ healthy/ fine/ well /strong-tempered /bad-tempered /near-sighted 
/far-sighted /foolish /stupid /silly /clever /smart /wise /bright / diligent 
/intelligent /lazy /hard working, etc. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
造句的原则：句式多变，语法活用，句子是表达一个完整意思的最小当位，所以造句能力在英文写作中是非常重要的。好的英语句子能够生动，形象，准确的表达内容。所以要想写出漂亮的书面表达，必须从写好句子开始。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 谋篇的原则：
