songs "Like a Virgin" and "Hollywood" at the awards ceremony. 

Madonna says she had some explaining to do when her daughter, Lourdes, asked 
about that kiss with Britney at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards.&nbsp; 
"(Lourdes) is really obsessed with who is gay ," says Madonna in an interview in Out 
magazine's April issue. "And she even asked, 'Mom, you know they say that you 
are gay?' And I'm, 'Oh, do they? Why?' And she says, 'Because you kissed Britney 
Spears.'" 
"And I said, 'No, it just means I kissed Britney Spears. I am the mommy pop 
star and she is the baby pop star. And I am kissing her to pass my energy on to 
her." 
Madonna, 47, famously locked lips with Spears, 24, while performing her songs 
"Like a Virgin" and "Hollywood" at the awards ceremony. 
The pop diva , considered by some 
to be an icon in the gay community, 
tells the magazine her 9-year-old daughter likes to guess who is gay: "Oh, and 
the other thing she likes to do when we go out, she says, 'Mom, do you want me 
to point out who the gay men are?' And I say, 'Okay, but I think I already 
know.'" 
Madonna also addresses her feud 
with Elton John, who in 2004 accused her of lip-synching. 
"He seems to be angry," she says. "I seem to have become a target. It's not 
very gentlemanly or gracious. But he did send me a letter apologizing for his 
last outburst, right before his wedding."

麦当娜日前透露，女儿劳尔黛斯要她解释，她在2003年MTV音乐颁奖典礼上与布兰妮接吻是怎么回事。 
"劳尔黛斯对谁是同性恋这个问题念念不忘，"麦当娜在接受《Out》杂志四月号刊采访时说："她甚至问我，'妈妈，你知道吗？有人说你是同性恋啊。'我很惊讶的反问，'是吗？为什么？'她说，'因为你和布兰妮接吻啊。'" 

"我说：'当然不是啦，那只能说明我吻了布兰妮。同是流行歌手，我是妈妈，她是孩子，我吻她只是把我的能量传送给她而以'。'" 
2003年MTV颁奖典礼上，47岁的麦当娜在演唱《宛若处女》和《好莱坞》两首歌时，因为与布兰妮接吻而引起哗然。 
这位流行乐坛天后被某些人视为同性恋圈子里的偶像级人物。她告诉《Out》杂志，9岁的女儿现在喜欢猜测谁是同性恋者，她说："我们出去时，她喜欢做的另一件事就是要问，'妈妈，你想让我指出谁是男同性恋吗？'我回答，'好的，但我想我已经知道了'。" 

采访中，麦当娜还提到了与埃尔顿・约翰之间的恩怨后者曾在2004年指责她假唱。 
麦当娜说："他看起来有满肚怒气，而我显然成了靶子。他这样做有失风度，也没气量，但就在他结婚之前给我写了一封道歉信，对他前一段的失控行为表示道歉。"
