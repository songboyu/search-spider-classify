
　　Doctors should stop wearing ties and traditional white coats to work 
because they might be responsible for spreading deadly hospital superbugs, 
according to a report on Monday.
　　The British Medical Association (BMA), which represents three-quarters of 
the country's doctors, said ties performed no beneficial function in treating 
patients and, as they were rarely washed, were a potential bug haven.
　　In Britain alone, up to 5,000 people every year are killed by hospital 
infections such as MRSA (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), costing 
the state-funded National Health Service as much as 1 billion pounds a year, the 
BMA said.
　　Washing hands properly was the most important action medical staff could 
take to help stop the spread of the so-called superbugs.
　　However other steps, such as doctors abandoning ties and other 
"functionless" clothing, could also help minimise the risk, said Peter Maguire, 
deputy chairman of the BMA's board of science.
　　"Hand-washing, wearing clothes that minimise the spread of infection such 
as clean, closely woven cotton, and stopping wearing ... functionless clothing 
such as ties will make a huge difference," Maguire added.
　　英国医师协会（BMA）在其2月20日发布的一份报告中指出，医生们在工作时不应当系领带，因为它们可能在一定程度上促进了各种“超级病菌”在医院内的传播。
　　据路透社2月20日报道，四分之三的英国医生均为BMA的成员，按照该协会报告的说法，在对病人的治疗过程中，领带不会起到丝毫正面作用，同时由于它们很少得到清洗，所以极易成为各种细菌的聚集地。
　　BMA还指出，仅在英国一地，每年便有多达5000人因在医院里感染诸如耐甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌（MRSA，俗称“超级病菌”）等细菌而死亡，而每年的经济损失则高达10亿英镑。
　　BMA下属的科学委员会的副主席彼得・马圭尔表示，为制止这些“超级病菌”在医院内的进一步传播，医务人员所能采取的最有效举措便是正确地洗手。此外还有其它一些行为降低相关风险，比如医生们不系领带且抛弃那些“华而不实”的着装。马圭尔说，“做为医务人员，你可以做到经常洗手，穿着那些能够减少细菌传播的服装，比如干净整洁且编织细密的棉布衣物等，同时摒弃诸如领带等毫无用处的服饰，上述举措均会使医院内的卫生状况大有改观”。
