For women bored 
at the thought of this summer's World Cup soccer finals in Germany, neighbor 
Switzerland is offering an alternative packed with beefcake. A cow-milking 'Mr. Switzerland' and many 
other handsome men are featured in the new advertising campaign seeking to entice soccer widows to leave their sports-obsessed men 
behind and go travel in Switzerland .
"Dear girls," says the television spot, to run in France, Germany and 
Switzerland beginning in May. 
"Why not escape this summer's World Cup to a country where men spend less 
time on football, and more time on you?" 
The advertisement, with images of a strapping 
farmhand, a sexy train conductor, 
a fit mountain climber, a dapper ferryman and a brawny lumberjack, ends with Renzo Blumenthal, Mr. 
Switzerland 2005, milking and then leaning up against a cow. 
The clip -- also on the official website www.myswitzerland.com -- is meant to 
lure women to Switzerland during the tournament that starts on June 9, Swiss 
Tourism spokeswoman Veronique Kanel said. 
"It was kind of a funny way to attract people, and of course mostly women, 
who are not interested in football to come to Switzerland while the men are 
watching the World Cup on television," she said in a telephone interview.

今年夏天，世界杯足球赛将在德国举行，邻国瑞士见缝插针，专门向那些一想起世界杯就头疼的女人们推出了一个“帅哥计划”。 
此项广告推广活动旨在吸引那些世界杯期间的“足球寡妇”们离开球迷丈夫，前往瑞士旅游。一位给奶牛挤奶的“瑞士先生”和其他一些"美男"们纷纷在广告中亮相。 
此电视广告短片将于5月份在法国、德国和瑞士播出，广告中说：“亲爱的姑娘们，为什么不逃离今夏的世界杯，前往另一个国度？这里的男人会将更多的时间花在你的身上，而不是足球。” 

身材魁梧的农场工人、性感的火车列车长、健美的登山运动员、潇洒的渡船夫、强壮的伐木工接连出现在广告中，短片的最后一个镜头是2005年度“瑞士先生” 
伦佐・布卢门塔尔给奶牛挤奶，然后站起来靠在奶牛的身上。 
瑞士旅游业发言人薇洛尼克・卡内尔说：“世界杯将于6月9日开幕，此则广告的目的就是在世界杯期间吸引太太们来瑞士游玩。目前此广告片已在官方网站www.myswitzerland.com上公布”。 
在一次电话采访中，卡内尔说：“这种做法很有意思，就是为了在男人们观看世界杯电视转播期间，吸引那些对足球不感兴趣的人来瑞士旅游。当然，目标主要瞄准女性。”
