they attended a morning service on April 9,2006. 

Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, marked their first 
wedding anniversary privately on April 9 at the Scottish estate where they spent their honeymoon..The 
couple, who recently returned from a trip to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and India, were 
relaxing at the royal Balmoral estate in Scotland. They planned no public 
celebration. 
Charles, 57, wearing a Scottish tweed kilt, and 
Camilla, 58, in a matching tweed jacket and skirt and red beret, smiled and waved at a small group of well-wishers 
gathered outside the nearby Crathie Parish Church, where they attended a morning service . 
The wedding had originally been scheduled for April 8, 2005, but was 
postponed a day so that Charles could attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II. 
The couple married in a small civil ceremony in Windsor, ending years of 
gossip about a relationship of more than 30 years. 
After a service attended by their families, they attended a religious service 
at Windsor Castle, in which Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams blessed the 
union . 
Camilla took the title Duchess of Cornwall rather than Princess of Wales, 
in deference to enduring public 
affection for Diana.(Agencies)

4月9日，查尔斯王储和妻子康沃尔公爵夫人卡米拉迎来了他们结婚一周年的纪念日。两人选在曾经共度蜜月的苏格兰庄园“秘密”庆祝。 
夫妇俩最近刚从埃及、沙特阿拉伯和印度出访归来，准备在王室领地苏格兰的巴尔莫勒尔庄园庆祝结婚纪念日，顺便放松一下。他们不打算大张旗鼓的公开庆祝。 
夫妇俩参加完克拉蒂教区教堂的早礼拜出来后，向聚集在教堂附近的一小群祝福者微笑并挥手致意。57的查尔斯身着一条苏格兰式方格斜纹软呢裙，58岁的卡米拉一套装束十分相称，她上身穿了一件斜纹软呢夹克，下身是一条方格长裙，头戴一顶红色贝雷帽。 

他们的婚礼原定于2005年4月8日举行，后因查尔斯要参加罗马教皇约翰・保罗二世的葬礼，所以推迟了一天。 
两人在温莎举行了一个“平民婚礼”，结为连理。至此，关于他们长达30多年恋情的流言蜚语也终于偃旗息鼓。 
在一个由家人参加的仪式后，他们出席了在温莎堡举行的宗教赐福仪式，仪式上，坎特伯雷大主教罗安・威廉斯向这对新人赐福。 
卡米拉没有获封“威尔士王妃”头衔，而是接受了“康沃尔公爵夫人”的称号，这样做是为了尊重民众对于戴安娜王妃的深厚感情。
